# IoT Datathon 3.0
#### Predicting dengue outbreaks

This repository contains the scripts used for preliminary data processing and results post processing. The model related code contained in the `neural-network` directory need to be run on [Autocaffe](https://autocaffe.io/).

The raw data (dengue, temperature, rainfall, and population) used for the model are private for the competition only, readers wishing to run this model will need to source for their own data.
